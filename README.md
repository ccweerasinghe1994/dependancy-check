# How To Proactively Manage Check For vulnerable Dependencies In A Gradle Project


To proactively manage and check for vulnerable dependencies in a Spring Boot project using Gradle or Maven, you can follow these steps:

### For Gradle:

1. **Use the Dependency-Check Plugin**: This plugin can analyze dependencies in your project and identify any known vulnerabilities.

    - **Step 1**: Apply the plugin in your `build.gradle` file.
    - **Step 2**: Configure the plugin with any necessary settings, such as the failure threshold.
    - **Step 3**: Run the plugin to generate a report.

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'org.owasp.dependencycheck' version '6.5.0'
}

dependencyCheck {
    // Configuration options
    failBuildOnCVSS = 7 // Example: Fail the build for vulnerabilities with CVSS score above 7
}
```

To run the check, use the command: `./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze`

### For Maven:

1. **Use the OWASP Dependency-Check Maven Plugin**: This plugin functions similarly to the Gradle plugin, scanning dependencies for vulnerabilities.

    - **Step 1**: Add the plugin to your `pom.xml`.
    - **Step 2**: Configure the plugin as needed.
    - **Step 3**: Run the plugin to perform the analysis.

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.owasp</groupId>
            <artifactId>dependency-check-maven</artifactId>
            <version>6.5.0</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>check</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
            <configuration>
                <!-- Configuration options -->
                <failBuildOnCVSS>7</failBuildOnCVSS> <!-- Example: Fail the build for vulnerabilities with CVSS score above 7 -->
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

To run the check, use the command: `mvn dependency-check:check`

### Continuous Monitoring:

- **Integrate with CI/CD**: Integrate the vulnerability check into your Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to ensure checks are performed automatically with each build or deployment.
- **Subscribe to Vulnerability Databases**: Stay informed about new vulnerabilities by subscribing to databases like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) or using services like Dependabot (for GitHub projects) which can automatically create pull requests to update dependencies.

By following these steps, you can proactively manage and mitigate the risks associated with using vulnerable dependencies in your Spring Boot projects.
